  <h6 align="center">INTRODUCTION</h6>
  <p align="center">Press a key and your Framer prototype becomes its own self-documenting, developer-ready spec. When enabled, Gotcha allows for precise information about your project's elements: from positions and colors to font styling and even component names and relationships. Best of all, Gotcha works seamlessly with Framer Cloud, so the links you send can work as specs, too. Give your developers something they can really use.</p>
